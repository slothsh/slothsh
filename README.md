## Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stefan.

I mostly work on CLI & web-applications to service my employer, but in these
chambers you will find a few collections of code that you may find interesting,
or, maybe, even outright lame.

Nonetheless, thanks for visiting, and feel free to take a look around!

### ðŸ‘¯ Collaboration

I come from an audio background, so naturally I'd like to work on any
projects that have their applications in audio! Plugins, real-time audio, etc.
If you've got any ideas, or are already championing the next project that's
going revolutionise the space, then I'd love to hear about it.
